# test-Hedrea-JS-SDK
JavaScript code for test Hedrea SDK

This package is just deploy one simple smart contract generated by the following Solidity code:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello World";
    }
}

But trying to deploy the generated bytecode seems not easy.
The current Hedra JS SDK version is: 2.35.0
My Node.js version: 20.5.0
My OS: Window 10 (22H2)
